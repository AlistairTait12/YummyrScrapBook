# What is this?
This repo is a companion to the following repos comprising the Yummyr project:
- YummyrDataAPI https://github.com/AlistairTait12/YummyrDataApi
- YummyrCommonLibrary (yet to be created)
- YummyrFrontEnd (yet to be created)

It contains code and other items that do not form part of the main repos, such as:
- Html components
- SQL snippets
- Example JSON responses

## Example JSON
These are example responses from the YummyrDataAPI, please note that the UnitOfMeasure property on the ingredient quantity models is shown as a number because it is an enum in the .NET project

## Postman Tests
This is a test collection which you can import into postman. Be sure to have the API running and then send the requests in the collection, the tests should pass

## SQL Folder
In this folder you can find some SQL queries to insert recipes quickly into the database _if it is your first time using the database_
