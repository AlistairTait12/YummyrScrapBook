It contains code and other items that do not form part of the main repos, such as:
- Html components
- SQL snippets
- Example JSON responses

## Example JSON
These are example responses from the YummyrDataAPI, please note that the UnitOfMeasure property on the ingredient quantity models is shown as a number because it is an enum in the .NET project
